This is the current TODO (high-level) list for the next improvements for the
LibPKI project. Please contact the project manager(s) or write to the devel
mailing lists for new ideas or to comment on these ideas.

Project's Next Steps:
=====================

- Provide support for OpenSSL v1.1+ (currently supported OpenSSL v0.9.x-v1.0.x

- Update the includes structure to avoid the inclusion of non-essentials
  headers in each file to speedup the compilation of the library

- Provide better documentation. In particular, we want to move all the
  documentation in the headers files to make it available to developers where
  it matter most. In our experience that should help a lot with the usability
  of the library in general (also man pages would really be useful)

- Update the support for CMS format. When the first interface to CMS was
  introduced in LibPKI, OpenSSL did not support it. Now that OpenSSL has its
  own implementation, we need to wrap it and provide similar interface to the
  PKCS#7 one. This will enable support for CMC (and EST - see next point)

- Add support for EST (the newer version of SCEP)

- Define new EST version and add support for mass-certificate issuing (e.g.,
  to support IoT certificate provisioning, renewal, and revocation)

- Complete the PKI_MSG interface to support EST

- Add support for JSON-based configuration files (still in debate if this
  would be useful and which JSON library to use)

- Add support for ACME protocol within the PKI_MSG interface (still in debate
  if this would be useful because of the poor design of the ACME protocol
  itself which is quite inefficient and mixes users and accounts management
  with PKI operations)

- Add support for revocation information distribution over DNS.

- Improve the test suite that does not provide good coverage for all the
  library functionalities

- Integrate support for dynamic as well as static analysis tools

for more information, please do not esitate to write to the development mailing
list (https://www.openca.org/projects/libpki) or to the project manager(s).

Enjoy OpenSource and PKIs!
